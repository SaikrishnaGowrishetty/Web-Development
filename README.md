# Web-Development
Developed my personal portfolio website and hosted it on UTA cloud. 
Front-End: HTML, CSS and JavaScript 
Back-End: MySQL Database in PhpMyAdmin 
Also developed the same website using Laravel, an open-source PHP web framework where I created MVC(Model-view-controller) for each webpage using Laravel framework.

Key Features:
• Users can Sign Up and Login to view exclusive content.
• It has a contact Page where users can send a message to me.
• It has an ‘Admin panel’, visible only to admins which is used for modifying the DB directly from front-end.
